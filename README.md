**Application Questions (Likely):**

**1. "Why do you want to join rtCamp?"**

**Answer (200 words):**
```
I'm excited about rtCamp because it combines enterprise-level WordPress 
development with modern full-stack technologies. Having built production 
applications with React and Node.js, I'm eager to apply these skills to 
WordPress solutions for Fortune 500 clients.

What particularly attracts me is rtCamp's remote-first culture and emphasis 
on open-source contributions. I've been preparing for GSoC 2026 and value 
companies that encourage community engagement. The opportunity to work on 
scalable solutions while learning from experienced engineers in a flexible 
environment aligns perfectly with my goals.

The tech stack—WordPress, React, Node.js, Docker—matches my expertise and 
learning trajectory. I'm confident I can contribute from day one while 
growing into more complex challenges. Additionally, the emphasis on client 
communication appeals to me as I believe great developers must understand 
user needs, not just write code.

rtCamp's 15+ year track record demonstrates stability while maintaining 
technical excellence, which is rare in the industry. I'm ready to bring my 
problem-solving mindset, full-stack capabilities, and passion for building 
impactful solutions to the team.
```

**2. "Describe your technical projects"**

**Answer:**
- Focus on your MERN project
- Mention GitHub repo
- Highlight: architecture, challenges, solutions
- Emphasize: deployed and functional

**3. "What technologies are you comfortable with?"**

**Answer:**
```
Proficient: JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, HTML5, CSS3, Git
Familiar: TypeScript, Next.js, SQL, Docker, REST APIs
Learning: AI/ML (LangChain), Kubernetes, WordPress/PHP
```

**4. "Why should we hire you?"**

**Answer (150 words):**
```
I'm not just a coder—I'm a builder. My GitHub shows production-ready 
applications, not just tutorial projects. I've deployed full-stack apps, 
handled real user scenarios, and understand the entire development lifecycle.

What sets me apart:
- Self-taught full-stack developer with working projects
- Problem-solver with 150+ DSA solutions (LeetCode/HackerRank)
- Quick learner (picked up MERN stack independently, now learning AI/ML)
- Remote work ready (disciplined, self-motivated)
- Strong communication skills (can explain technical concepts clearly)

I thrive in environments that value ownership and impact over credentials. 
rtCamp's remote culture and technical challenges excite me because I can 
contribute meaningfully from day one while learning WordPress ecosystem 
alongside modern frameworks I already know.

I'm ready to ship quality code, collaborate with the team, and grow with 
rtCamp for the long term.
